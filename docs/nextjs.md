Project structure and organization
This page provides an overview of all the folder and file conventions in Next.js, and recommendations for organizing your project.

Folder and file conventions
Top-level folders
Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

Route segments to path segments
app	App Router
pages	Pages Router
public	Static assets to be served
src	Optional application source folder
Top-level files
Top-level files are used to configure your application, manage dependencies, run middleware, integrate monitoring tools, and define environment variables.

Next.js	
next.config.js	Configuration file for Next.js
package.json	Project dependencies and scripts
instrumentation.ts	OpenTelemetry and Instrumentation file
middleware.ts	Next.js request middleware
.env	Environment variables
.env.local	Local environment variables
.env.production	Production environment variables
.env.development	Development environment variables
.eslintrc.json	Configuration file for ESLint
.gitignore	Git files and folders to ignore
next-env.d.ts	TypeScript declaration file for Next.js
tsconfig.json	Configuration file for TypeScript
jsconfig.json	Configuration file for JavaScript
Routing Files
Add page to expose a route, layout for shared UI such as header, nav, or footer, loading for skeletons, error for error boundaries and route for APIs.

layout	.js .jsx .tsx	Layout
page	.js .jsx .tsx	Page
loading	.js .jsx .tsx	Loading UI
not-found	.js .jsx .tsx	Not found UI
error	.js .jsx .tsx	Error UI
global-error	.js .jsx .tsx	Global error UI
route	.js .ts	API endpoint
template	.js .jsx .tsx	Re-rendered layout
default	.js .jsx .tsx	Parallel route fallback page
Nested routes
Folders define URL segments. Nesting folders nests segments. Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. A route becomes public when a page or route file exists.

Path	URL pattern	Notes
app/layout.tsx	—	Root layout wraps all routes
app/blog/layout.tsx	—	Wraps /blog and descendants
app/page.tsx	/	Public route
app/blog/page.tsx	/blog	Public route
app/blog/authors/page.tsx	/blog/authors	Public route
Dynamic routes
Parameterize segments with square brackets. Use [segment] for a single param, [...segment] for catch‑all, and [[...segment]] for optional catch‑all. Access values via the params prop.

Path	URL pattern
app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx	/blog/my-first-post
app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx	/shop/clothing/shoes, /shop/clothing/shirts
app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx	/docs, /docs/layouts-and-pages, /docs/api-reference/use-router
Route Groups and private folders
Organize code without changing URLs with route groups (group), and colocate non-routable files with private folders _folder.

Path	URL pattern	Notes
app/(marketing)/page.tsx	/	Group omitted from URL
app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx	/cart	Share layouts within (shop)
app/blog/_components/Post.tsx	—	Not routable; safe place for UI utilities
app/blog/_lib/data.ts	—	Not routable; safe place for utils
Parallel and Intercepted Routes
These features fit specific UI patterns, such as slot-based layouts or modal routing.

Use @slot for named slots rendered by a parent layout. Use intercept patterns to render another route inside the current layout without changing the URL, for example, to show a details view as a modal over a list.

Pattern (docs)	Meaning	Typical use case
@folder	Named slot	Sidebar + main content
(.)folder	Intercept same level	Preview sibling route in a modal
(..)folder	Intercept parent	Open parent child as overlay
(..)(..)folder	Intercept two levels	Deeply nested overlay
(...)folder	Intercept from root	Show arbitrary route in current view

Organizing your project
Next.js is unopinionated about how you organize and colocate your project files. But it does provide several features to help you organize your project.

Component hierarchy
The components defined in special files are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

layout.js
template.js
error.js (React error boundary)
loading.js (React suspense boundary)
not-found.js (React error boundary)
page.js or nested layout.js
Component Hierarchy for File Conventions
The components are rendered recursively in nested routes, meaning the components of a route segment will be nested inside the components of its parent segment.

Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy
Colocation
In the app directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.

A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.
And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the content returned by page.js or route.js is sent to the client.

A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.
This means that project files can be safely colocated inside route segments in the app directory without accidentally being routable.

A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.
Good to know: While you can colocate your project files in app you don't have to. If you prefer, you can keep them outside the app directory.

Private folders
Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: _folderName

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby opting the folder and all its subfolders out of routing.

An example folder structure using private folders
Since files in the app directory can be safely colocated by default, private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

Separating UI logic from routing logic.
Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.
Good to know:

While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with %5F (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): %5FfolderName.
If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js special file conventions to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.
Route groups
Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: (folderName)

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should not be included in the route's URL path.

An example folder structure using route groups
Route groups are useful for:

Organizing routes by site section, intent, or team. e.g. marketing pages, admin pages, etc.
Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts
Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment
src folder
Next.js supports storing application code (including app) inside an optional src folder. This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

An example folder structure with the `src` folder
Examples
The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

Good to know: In our examples below, we're using components and lib folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like ui, utils, hooks, styles, etc.

Store project files outside of app
This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the root of your project and keeps the app directory purely for routing purposes.

An example folder structure with project files outside of app
Store project files in top-level folders inside of app
This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the root of the app directory.

An example folder structure with project files inside app
Split project files by feature or route
This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root app directory and splits more specific application code into the route segments that use them.

An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route
Organize routes without affecting the URL path
To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. (marketing) or (shop)).

Organizing Routes with Route Groups
Even though routes inside (marketing) and (shop) share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a layout.js file inside their folders.

Route Groups with Multiple Layouts
Opting specific segments into a layout
To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. (shop)) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. account and cart). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. checkout).

Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts
Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route
To apply a loading skeleton via a loading.js file to a specific route, create a new route group (e.g., /(overview)) and then move your loading.tsx inside that route group.

Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group
Now, the loading.tsx file will only apply to your dashboard → overview page instead of all your dashboard pages without affecting the URL path structure.

Creating multiple root layouts
To create multiple root layouts, remove the top-level layout.js file, and add a layout.js file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The <html> and <body> tags need to be added to each root layout.

Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts
In the example above, both (marketing) and (shop) have their own root layout.
Layouts and Pages
Next.js uses file-system based routing, meaning you can use folders and files to define routes. This page will guide you through how to create layouts and pages, and link between them.

Creating a page
A page is UI that is rendered on a specific route. To create a page, add a page file inside the app directory and default export a React component. For example, to create an index page (/):

page.js special file
app/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello Next.js!</h1>
}
Creating a layout
A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not rerender.

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout file. The component should accept a children prop which can be a page or another layout.

For example, to create a layout that accepts your index page as child, add a layout file inside the app directory:

layout.js special file
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Layout UI */}
        {/* Place children where you want to render a page or nested layout */}
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
The layout above is called a root layout because it's defined at the root of the app directory. The root layout is required and must contain html and body tags.

Creating a nested route
A nested route is a route composed of multiple URL segments. For example, the /blog/[slug] route is composed of three segments:

/ (Root Segment)
blog (Segment)
[slug] (Leaf Segment)
In Next.js:

Folders are used to define the route segments that map to URL segments.
Files (like page and layout) are used to create UI that is shown for a segment.
To create nested routes, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, to add a route for /blog, create a folder called blog in the app directory. Then, to make /blog publicly accessible, add a page.tsx file:

File hierarchy showing blog folder and a page.js file
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

// Dummy imports
import { getPosts } from '@/lib/posts'
import { Post } from '@/ui/post'
 
export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
 
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
You can continue nesting folders to create nested routes. For example, to create a route for a specific blog post, create a new [slug] folder inside blog and add a page file:

File hierarchy showing blog folder with a nested slug folder and a page.js file
app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

function generateStaticParams() {}
 
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Blog Post Page!</h1>
}
Wrapping a folder name in square brackets (e.g. [slug]) creates a dynamic route segment which is used to generate multiple pages from data. e.g. blog posts, product pages, etc.

Nesting layouts
By default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are also nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their children prop. You can nest layouts by adding layout inside specific route segments (folders).

For example, to create a layout for the /blog route, add a new layout file inside the blog folder.

File hierarchy showing root layout wrapping the blog layout
app/blog/layout.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export default function BlogLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (app/layout.js) would wrap the blog layout (app/blog/layout.js), which would wrap the blog (app/blog/page.js) and blog post page (app/blog/[slug]/page.js).

Creating a dynamic segment
Dynamic segments allow you to create routes that are generated from data. For example, instead of manually creating a route for each individual blog post, you can create a dynamic segment to generate the routes based on blog post data.

To create a dynamic segment, wrap the segment (folder) name in square brackets: [segmentName]. For example, in the app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx route, the [slug] is the dynamic segment.

app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export default async function BlogPostPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = await getPost(slug)
 
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
Learn more about Dynamic Segments and the params props.

Nested layouts within Dynamic Segments, can also access the params props.

Rendering with search params
In a Server Component page, you can access search parameters using the searchParams prop:

app/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}) {
  const filters = (await searchParams).filters
}
Using searchParams opts your page into dynamic rendering because it requires a incoming request to read the search parameters from.

Client Components can read search params using the useSearchParams hook.

Learn more about useSearchParams in statically rendered and dynamically rendered routes.

What to use and when
Use the searchParams prop when you need search parameters to load data for the page (e.g. pagination, filtering from a database).
Use useSearchParams when search parameters are used only on the client (e.g. filtering a list already loaded via props).
As a small optimization, you can use new URLSearchParams(window.location.search) in callbacks or event handlers to read search params without triggering re-renders.
Linking between pages
You can use the <Link> component to navigate between routes. <Link> is a built-in Next.js component that extends the HTML <a> tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation.

For example, to generate a list of blog posts, import <Link> from next/link and pass a href prop to the component:

app/ui/post.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

import Link from 'next/link'
 
export default async function Post({ post }) {
  const posts = await getPosts()
 
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.slug}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
Good to know: <Link> is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js. You can also use the useRouter hook for more advanced navigation.

Route Props Helpers
Next.js exposes utility types that infer params and named slots from your route structure:

PageProps: Props for page components, including params and searchParams.
LayoutProps: Props for layout components, including children and any named slots (e.g. folders like @analytics).
These are globally available helpers, generated when running either next dev, next build or next typegen.

app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx

export default async function Page(props: PageProps<'/blog/[slug]'>) {
  const { slug } = await props.params
  return <h1>Blog post: {slug}</h1>
}
app/dashboard/layout.tsx

export default function Layout(props: LayoutProps<'/dashboard'>) {
  return (
    <section>
      {props.children}
      {/* If you have app/dashboard/@analytics, it appears as a typed slot: */}
      {/* {props.analytics} */}
    </section>
  )
}
Good to know

Static routes resolve params to {}.
PageProps, LayoutProps are global helpers — no imports required.
Types are generated during next dev, next build or next typegen.

Linking and Navigating
In Next.js, routes are rendered on the server by default. This often means the client has to wait for a server response before a new route can be shown. Next.js comes with built-in prefetching, streaming, and client-side transitions ensuring navigation stays fast and responsive.

This guide explains how navigation works in Next.js and how you can optimize it for dynamic routes and slow networks.

How navigation works
To understand how navigation works in Next.js, it helps to be familiar with the following concepts:

Server Rendering
Prefetching
Streaming
Client-side transitions
Server Rendering
In Next.js, Layouts and Pages are React Server Components by default. On initial and subsequent navigations, the Server Component Payload is generated on the server before being sent to the client.

There are two types of server rendering, based on when it happens:

Static Rendering (or Prerendering) happens at build time or during revalidation and the result is cached.
Dynamic Rendering happens at request time in response to a client request.
The trade-off of server rendering is that the client must wait for the server to respond before the new route can be shown. Next.js addresses this delay by prefetching routes the user is likely to visit and performing client-side transitions.

Good to know: HTML is also generated for the initial visit.

Prefetching
Prefetching is the process of loading a route in the background before the user navigates to it. This makes navigation between routes in your application feel instant, because by the time a user clicks on a link, the data to render the next route is already available client side.

Next.js automatically prefetches routes linked with the <Link> component when they enter the user's viewport.

app/layout.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

import Link from 'next/link'
 
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
How much of the route is prefetched depends on whether it's static or dynamic:

Static Route: the full route is prefetched.
Dynamic Route: prefetching is skipped, or the route is partially prefetched if loading.tsx is present.
By skipping or partially prefetching dynamic routes, Next.js avoids unnecessary work on the server for routes the users may never visit. However, waiting for a server response before navigation can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

Server Rendering without Streaming
To improve the navigation experience to dynamic routes, you can use streaming.

Streaming
Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client as soon as they're ready, rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered. This means users see something sooner, even if parts of the page are still loading.

For dynamic routes, it means they can be partially prefetched. That is, shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.

How Server Rendering with Streaming Works
To use streaming, create a loading.tsx in your route folder:

loading.js special file
app/dashboard/loading.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
Behind the scenes, Next.js will automatically wrap the page.tsx contents in a <Suspense> boundary. The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.

Good to know: You can also use <Suspense> to create loading UI for nested components.

Benefits of loading.tsx:

Immediate navigation and visual feedback for the user.
Shared layouts remain interactive and navigation is interruptible.
Improved Core Web Vitals: TTFB, FCP, and TTI.
To further improve the navigation experience, Next.js performs a client-side transition with the <Link> component.

Client-side transitions
Traditionally, navigation to a server-rendered page triggers a full page load. This clears state, resets scroll position, and blocks interactivity.

Next.js avoids this with client-side transitions using the <Link> component. Instead of reloading the page, it updates the content dynamically by:

Keeping any shared layouts and UI.
Replacing the current page with the prefetched loading state or a new page if available.
Client-side transitions are what makes a server-rendered apps feel like client-rendered apps. And when paired with prefetching and streaming, it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.

What can make transitions slow?
These Next.js optimizations make navigation fast and responsive. However, under certain conditions, transitions can still feel slow. Here are some common causes and how to improve the user experience:

Dynamic routes without loading.tsx
When navigating to a dynamic route, the client must wait for the server response before showing the result. This can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

We recommend adding loading.tsx to dynamic routes to enable partial prefetching, trigger immediate navigation, and display a loading UI while the route renders.

app/blog/[slug]/loading.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
Good to know: In development mode, you can use the Next.js Devtools to identify if the route is static or dynamic. See devIndicators for more information.

Dynamic segments without generateStaticParams
If a dynamic segment could be prerendered but isn't because it's missing generateStaticParams, the route will fallback to dynamic rendering at request time.

Ensure the route is statically generated at build time by adding generateStaticParams:

app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())
 
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))
}
 
export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
Slow networks
On slow or unstable networks, prefetching may not finish before the user clicks a link. This can affect both static and dynamic routes. In these cases, the loading.js fallback may not appear immediately because it hasn't been prefetched yet.

To improve perceived performance, you can use the useLinkStatus hook to show inline visual feedback to the user (like spinners or text glimmers on the link) while a transition is in progress.

app/ui/loading-indicator.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'
 
export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return pending ? (
    <div role="status" aria-label="Loading" className="spinner" />
  ) : null
}
You can "debounce" the loading indicator by adding an initial animation delay (e.g. 100ms) and starting the animation as invisible (e.g. opacity: 0). This means the loading indicator will only be shown if the navigation takes longer than the specified delay.


.spinner {
  /* ... */
  opacity: 0;
  animation:
    fadeIn 500ms 100ms forwards,
    rotate 1s linear infinite;
}
 
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
 
@keyframes rotate {
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
Good to know: You can use other visual feedback patterns like a progress bar. View an example here.

Disabling prefetching
You can opt out of prefetching by setting the prefetch prop to false on the <Link> component. This is useful to avoid unnecessary usage of resources when rendering large lists of links (e.g. an infinite scroll table).


<Link prefetch={false} href="/blog">
  Blog
</Link>
However, disabling prefetching comes with trade-offs:

Static routes will only be fetched when the user clicks the link.
Dynamic routes will need to be rendered on the server first before the client can navigate to it.
To reduce resource usage without fully disabling prefetch, you can prefetch only on hover. This limits prefetching to routes the user is more likely to visit, rather than all links in the viewport.

app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.tsx
TypeScript

TypeScript

'use client'
 
import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'
 
function HoverPrefetchLink({
  href,
  children,
}: {
  href: string
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
 
  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
Hydration not completed
<Link> is a Client Component and must be hydrated before it can prefetch routes. On the initial visit, large JavaScript bundles can delay hydration, preventing prefetching from starting right away.

React mitigates this with Selective Hydration and you can further improve this by:

Using the @next/bundle-analyzer plugin to identify and reduce bundle size by removing large dependencies.
Moving logic from the client to the server where possible. See the Server and Client Components docs for guidance.
Examples
Native History API
Next.js allows you to use the native window.history.pushState and window.history.replaceState methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.

pushState and replaceState calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with usePathname and useSearchParams.

window.history.pushState
Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:


'use client'
 
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'
 
export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()
 
  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }
 
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
window.history.replaceState
Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:


'use client'
 
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
 
export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()
 
  function switchLocale(locale: string) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }
 
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}
